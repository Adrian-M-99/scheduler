# scheduler
Personal project that helped me learn several Java concepts and related technologies, such as OOP, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, etc.
This project is an Web App representing a schedule-managing platform for a medical clinic. 
Patients can create accounts in order to schedule appointments, and the users with Staff role or higher(currently Admin only) can modify the appointments, patient accounts, doctor entries, etc.
